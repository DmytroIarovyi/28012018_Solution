## Quick setup before running tests:
1. Chrome browser should be installed
2. Download all files from repo locally
3. Open solution (.sln) in Visual Studio (Community (free) will be enough)

Enjoy watching the test :)

### P.S. In case you see "Windows Defender Settings" in Chrome browser during test run, you need to do next:
1. WinKey + R -> regedit -> Enter  (open registry)
2. Go to "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Google\Chrome"
3. Find key "TriggeredReset"
4. Delete it

These steps will fix the issue.
